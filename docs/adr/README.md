# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for TWS Foundations.

## What are ADRs?

ADRs document significant architectural decisions made in the project, including the context, decision, and consequences. They help developers (and LLMs) understand **why** decisions were made, not just what they are.

## Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

- **Status**: Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: What problem are we solving?
- **Decision**: What did we decide?
- **Consequences**: What are the trade-offs?
