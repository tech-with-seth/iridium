# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-01-10
Feature: marketing-copy-enhancements

## Codebase Patterns
- Hero section lives in `app/routes/landing.tsx` with A/B test variants via feature flags
- Intro copy has control and variant versions toggled by `home_page_intro_copy` flag
- Use `GitHubCta` component for CTA buttons with consistent styling

## 2026-01-10 - US-001
- Implemented benefit-focused hero section
- Changed headline from "Welcome to Iridium" to "Ship Your SaaS, Not Boilerplate"
- Rewrote both intro copy variants to address pain points (time savings, decision fatigue)
- Updated CTA from "View on GitHub" to "Start Building Your SaaS"
- Updated page title and meta description
- Files changed: `app/routes/landing.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The landing page uses feature flags for A/B testing hero images and intro copy
  - `introCopyControl` and `introCopyVariant` are the two versions of subheadline copy
  - `GitHubCta` is a reusable component defined inline in the landing page
